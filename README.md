## Basic Examples

### Print a Message

```yaml
service: escpos_printer.print_text
data:
  text: "Hello from Home Assistant!"
  align: center
  cut: partial
```

### Print a QR Code

```yaml
service: escpos_printer.print_qr
data:
  data: "https://www.home-assistant.io"
  size: 8
  align: center
  cut: partial
```

### Target a Specific Printer

When you have multiple printers, use `target` to pick which one:

```yaml
service: escpos_printer.print_text
target:
  device_id: your_printer_device_id

  text: "Sent to a specific printer"
  cut: partial
```

Omit `target` to broadcast to all configured printers.
